   abstract = {Rainfall is a natural climatic phenomenon and prediction of its value is crucial for weather forecasting. For time series data forecasting, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is shown to be superior as compared to other machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this research work, a LSTM network is developed to predict daily average rainfall values using meteorological data obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Department for Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Six daily meteorology data, namely, minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), mean temperature (°C), mean wind speed (m/s), mean sea level pressure (hPa) and mean relative humidity (%) from the year 2009 to 2013 were used as the input of the LSTM prediction model. The accuracy of the predicted daily average rainfall was assessed using coefficient determinant (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Contrary to the common practice of dividing the whole available data set into training, validation and testing sub-sets, the developed LSTM model in this study was applied to forecast the daily average rainfall for the month December 2013 while training was done using the data prior of this month. An analysis on the testing data showed that, the data is more spread out in the testing set as compared to the training data. As LSTM requires the right setting of hyper-parameters, an analysis on the effects of the number of maximum epochs and the mini-batch size on the rainfall prediction accuracy were carried out in this study. From the experiments, a five layers LSTM model with number of maximum epoch of 10 and mini-batch size of 100 managed to achieve the best prediction at an average RMSE of 20.67 mm and R2 = 0.82.},

   abstract = {The predictions of extreme events by the {U}nified Forecast System (UFS) Coupled Model Prototype 5 of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction over the contiguous United States during boreal summer are assessed. The extreme events in precipitation and daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature in weeks 1–4 predictions are analyzed in the deterministic retrospective forecasts of UFS during 2011–2017. The spatial structures of the extreme events in precipitation are reasonably well predicted but with higher values. Although the predictions of the temperature are closer to observation over central and eastern parts of the US, the model fails to generate the extreme events over large western regions. There is no appreciable growth of forecast errors of extreme events during weeks 1–4. While the spatial correlation of the number of extreme events between the forecasts and observation is very low for precipitation and temperature, the correlation of the temperature per event is very high. The model is able to better predict the observed location and magnitude of temperature events whenever it can generate such events. The number of precipitation events in the forecasts is higher than in the observation but with less accuracy in location and magnitude. The influence of slowly varying modes related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) and warming trend of the ocean on the extreme events are also studied. All three modes have enhancing influence on precipitation while only the ENSO mode enhances the maximum temperature events. The minimum temperature events are enhanced by ENSO and ISO but diminished by the warming trend.},

   abstract = {In this study, the interannual variations of winter precipitation over central Asia (CA) are investigated over the period 1948–2018 using both observational analysis and a linear baroclinic model (LBM). The focus is on the characteristics and factors of the leading empirical orthogonal function mode (EOF1) of winter precipitation over CA. The results show that the key circulation anomalies associated with the positive phase of EOF1 feature a tripole pattern that is responsible for transporting moisture from the subtropical North Atlantic region to CA. An examination of the lower boundary conditions indicates that anomalous North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), Kara Sea ice in the preceding autumn, and simultaneous snow cover in central Asia can promote large-scale atmospheric waves that contribute to the EOF1-related anomalous tripole pattern. This result is verified by an analysis of the apparent heat source (Q1) in the atmosphere and the LBM experiments. Linear regression (LR) models were constructed using the precursors revealed by the above observational analyses to perform hindcasts for EOF1 over the period 1950–2018. The North Atlantic SST and the Kara Sea ice in the preceding autumn are shown to be effective predictors in the LR model that can capture the variation in EOF1 during this period. The seasonal forecasts of winter precipitation over CA for the 2011–18 period based on the LR models outperform those of the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) over central and northern CA.},

   abstract = {In this work, we study the short-term dynamics of the Surface Air Temperature (SAT) using data obtained from a meteorological station in Bogotá from 2009 to 2019 and using time series. The data that we used correspond to the monthly mean of the historical registers of SAT and three pollutants. A descriptive analysis of the data follows. Then, some predictions are obtained from two different approaches: (i) a univariate analysis of SAT through a SARIMA model, which shows a good fit; and (ii) a multivariate analysis of SAT and pollutants using a SVAR model. Suitable transformations were first applied on the original dataset to work with stationary time series. Subsequently, A SARIMA model and a VAR(2) with its associated SVAR model are estimated. Furthermore, we obtain one-year forecasts for the logarithm of SAT in both models. Our forecasts simulate the natural fluctuation of SAT, presenting peaks and valleys in months when SAT is high and low, respectively. The SVAR model allows us to identify certain shocks that affect the instant relationships among variables. These relations were studied by the impulse-response function and the VAR model variance decomposition. Although the statistical methods used in this study are classical, they continue being widely used in the environmental field, presenting god fits, and the results obtained in this study are consistent with environmental theories.},
